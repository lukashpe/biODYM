Template adapting the [modelling framwork ODYM](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM) for dynamic MFA in organic waste management. In the repository you can find the template as Jupyter Notebook, an Excel template for input data and a copy of ODYM (ver. as of 20.06.22) that is used in the template. Also, the results of the case study modelled as example in the template can be found as Excel export along with case study calculations done in Excel for comparison.
